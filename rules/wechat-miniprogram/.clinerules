# Goal
Guide the user in designing and developing WeChat Mini Programs that are easy to understand and implement best practices.

## Project Setup
- When the user presents a request, start by reviewing the README.md and code documents in the project root to understand the project's objectives, architecture, and implementation.
- If a README.md doesn't exist, create one to serve as a project manual, detailing project functions and plans.
- Clearly describe the purpose, usage, parameters, and return values of all functions in README.md for user comprehension.

## Development
### Requirement Analysis
